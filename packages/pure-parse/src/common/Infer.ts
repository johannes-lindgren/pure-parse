/**
 * Extract the type from a parser or guards
 * - In parsers, extract the type in the type parameter.
 * - In guards, extract the type in the [type predicate](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/advanced-types.html#using-type-predicates).
 * @example
 * type User = Infer<typeof parseUser>
 * @example
 * type User = Infer<typeof isUser>
 * @limitations Optional properties will be inferred as required properties that can be assigned `undefined` (unions with `undefined`). At runtime, the property _is_ optional: only the inferred type has a discrepancy. For most use cases, this is not a problem. If you are adamant on being correct, consider declaring the type instead of inferring it (see the following section). This might be due to limitations of TypeScript; future versions of this library might provide a solution.
 * @typeParam T â€” a parser or guard
